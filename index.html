<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<img src="images/elsa.jpg" alt="This is me" style="width:25%;height:25%;">

<p>My name is Elsa Gomez. Born and raised in Monterrey, Mexico, I arrived to NY in 2012 to study English for one year. I fell in love with New York and decided that it was the city where I wanted to live forever. So I decided to enroll in Baruch College and get a Marketing and Finance Certificate.</p>

<p>I graduated in 2015 and got a job in the Energy Industry, where I currently work as a Marketing Coordinator. I love Marketing, as much as I like dancing and coding. But there are two things that I love more, my adorable nieces, my family and my boyfriend and his family. </p>
